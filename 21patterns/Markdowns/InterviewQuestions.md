Here are all the interview questions we've discussed:

1. **PySpark Shuffle Optimization**: How would you optimize the performance of a PySpark job that involves a large shuffle operation?
2. **Data Lakehouse Explanation**: Can you explain what a data lakehouse is and how it differs from a traditional data warehouse and a data lake?
3. **Handling Concurrent Requests in FastAPI**: Imagine you have a REST API built with FastAPI, and you need to handle a high volume of concurrent requests. What strategies would you use to ensure the system scales efficiently?
4. **ETL Pipeline for Data Quality**: You're tasked with designing an ETL pipeline that processes data from various sources, transforms it, and loads it into a data lakehouse. How would you ensure data quality and integrity throughout this pipeline?
5. **Optimizing Complex PySpark Transformations**: You're working with a PySpark DataFrame and need to perform a complex transformation involving multiple joins and aggregations. How would you approach optimizing this transformation to improve performance?
6. **`reduceByKey` vs. `groupByKey` in Spark**: Can you explain the difference between `reduceByKey` and `groupByKey` in PySpark, and when to use one over the other?
7. **Equivalent of `reduceByKey` in Spark SQL**: What is the equivalent of `reduceByKey` in Spark SQL, and how would you achieve similar functionality?
8. **Architecting a Scalable Data Pipeline**: Imagine you're designing a data pipeline that needs to integrate data from multiple sources, including batch and real-time streaming data. How would you architect this pipeline to ensure scalability and low-latency processing?
9. **PySpark `persist` vs. `cache`**: In PySpark, what is the purpose of the `persist` method, and how does it differ from `cache`? Can you provide an example of when you would use `persist` over `cache`?
10. **What is a Partition in Spark?**: Can you explain what a partition is in the context of Spark, and how it affects performance?
11. **UDF in PySpark**: Can you explain what a UDF (User-Defined Function) is in PySpark and when you might want to use one? Additionally, what are some considerations or drawbacks when using UDFs?

1. **ETL Pipelines:** Can you explain the steps involved in designing an ETL pipeline for a data lakehouse environment?
2. **Data Lakehouse:** What are the key benefits of using a data lakehouse architecture over traditional data warehouses?
3. **FastAPI:** How would you use FastAPI to create an API endpoint for ingesting data into a data lake?
4. **Python Advanced:** Can you discuss how you would use Python's `itertools` to efficiently process large datasets?
5. **PySpark:** How does PySpark handle data partitioning, and why is it important for performance optimization?
6. **Spark Memory Optimizations:** What strategies can be used for Spark memory optimization to improve job performance?

Here are the interview questions mentioned:

1. **Can you tell me about a challenging project you led, the obstacles you faced, and how you overcame them?**
2. **Can you discuss a time when you had to influence a key decision in a project without having direct authority? How did you approach it, and what was the outcome?**
3. **Can you explain the concept of eventual consistency in distributed systems and how it's different from strong consistency?**
