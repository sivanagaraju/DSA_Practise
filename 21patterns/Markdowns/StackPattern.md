**1. Core Concepts and Coding Patterns:**

The **Stack Pattern** is a fundamental concept used in solving problems where there is a natural order of elements that need to be processed in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner. A stack can be visualized as a collection of plates, where you can only remove or add a plate to the top. The Stack Pattern is commonly used to:

- Track previous states (e.g., undo mechanisms).
- Manage function calls or nested elements.
- Solve problems involving backtracking.
- Process elements where you need to keep track of recently accessed items (e.g., balanced parentheses, histogram problems).

Typical use cases include: evaluating mathematical expressions, backtracking, depth-first search (DFS), and keeping track of previous states.

**How It Works:** A stack has two primary operations:

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove the element from the top of the stack.

**Example:** Imagine a stack of numbers where you need to reverse the order in which they appear. For numbers [1, 2, 3, 4]:
- **Push order**: 1, 2, 3, 4 (added to the stack one by one).
- **Pop order**: 4, 3, 2, 1 (elements removed in reverse).

**2. Numeric Examples:**

Consider the problem of balancing parentheses: "((a+b)*c)-(d/e)".

- As we iterate through the string, we push every "(" onto the stack.
- When we encounter ")", we pop from the stack.
- If the stack is empty when we need to pop, or there are unmatched "(", the parentheses are not balanced.
- Final stack state should be empty for a balanced expression.

**3. Problem Identification Checklist:**

| Criteria                        | Example Problem                                  |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Need to track order in LIFO     | Checking balanced parentheses in expressions.    |
| Problem involves backtracking   | Solving a maze using recursive backtracking.     |
| Nested structures are involved  | Parsing HTML/XML tags to ensure they are closed. |

**4. General Templates with Comments:**

### Template 1: Simple Stack Usage
```python
# Template: Balancing Parentheses
# Use case: Balancing symbols in an expression.
def is_balanced(expression):
    stack = []
    # Dictionary for matching pairs
    pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in '([{':
            # Push opening brackets onto the stack
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in ')]}':
            # Pop for closing brackets
            if not stack or stack[-1] != pairs[char]:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    # Stack should be empty if balanced
    return len(stack) == 0
```
**Use Case:** Used for problems involving well-formed strings (parentheses, brackets).

**Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.
**Space Complexity:** O(n) for the stack in the worst case.

### Template 2: Monotonic Stack
```python
# Template: Finding Next Greater Element
# Use case: Finding the next greater element for each element in an array.
def next_greater_elements(arr):
    stack = []
    result = [-1] * len(arr)
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Maintain elements in decreasing order in stack
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            index = stack.pop()
            result[index] = arr[i]
        stack.append(i)
    return result
```
**Use Case:** Suitable for problems involving comparisons among elements like Next Greater Element, Stock Span, etc.

**Time Complexity:** O(n).
**Space Complexity:** O(n).

**5. Complexity Analysis:**

- **Time Complexity:** Generally, O(n) for each stack operation, where n represents the number of elements processed (push/pop).
- **Space Complexity:** Usually O(n) due to stack usage for recursive calls or storing elements.
- **Optimization:** Can optimize space in problems that involve only traversal by using implicit call stack or memoization.

**6. Discussion on Templates and Patterns:**

Each stack template can be adjusted depending on the question's specifics. The `next_greater_elements` template, for instance, can also be modified to find the **previous smaller element** by reversing the order and changing the comparison. Flexibility in modifying these templates to suit related variations is a core skill.

**7. Multiple Approaches and Implementations:**

- **Iterative vs Recursive:** A **recursive** solution for problems like DFS uses the function call stack, while an **iterative** solution would use an explicit stack.
- **Comparison:** Recursive solutions can be concise but may lead to **stack overflow** for deep recursion, while iterative solutions can handle larger inputs but require more manual management.

**9. Practice Problems:**

- **Mistakes to Avoid:** Forgetting to handle edge cases like an empty stack or mismatched elements when popping can lead to incorrect results.
- **Troubleshooting Tips:** Use print statements to monitor stack state changes and validate intermediate results.

Sure! Here are detailed explanations for 7 randomly selected practice problems, including numeric examples, Python code with comments, and visualizations if needed:

### 1. Next Greater Element in Array
**Problem:** Given an array, find the next greater element for each element in the array. If no greater element exists, output -1 for that position.

**Example:**
- Input: `[2, 1, 2, 4, 3]`
- Output: `[4, 2, 4, -1, -1]`

**Explanation:**
- For `2`, the next greater element is `4`.
- For `1`, the next greater element is `2`.
- For `2`, the next greater element is `4`.
- For `4`, there is no greater element, hence `-1`.
- For `3`, there is no greater element, hence `-1`.

**Python Code:**
```python
def next_greater_elements(arr):
    stack = []
    result = [-1] * len(arr)
    
    # Traverse through the array
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # Pop elements from the stack until we find a greater element
        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:
            index = stack.pop()
            result[index] = arr[i]
        # Push the current index to the stack
        stack.append(i)
    
    return result

# Example usage
arr = [2, 1, 2, 4, 3]
print(next_greater_elements(arr))  # Output: [4, 2, 4, -1, -1]
```

### 2. Min Stack
**Problem:** Implement a stack that supports `push`, `pop`, `top`, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

**Example:**
- Operations: `push(2)`, `push(0)`, `push(3)`, `push(0)`, `pop()`, `min()`
- Output: `[0, 0, 2]`

**Explanation:**
- Pushing `2`, `0`, `3`, and `0` results in the stack `[2, 0, 3, 0]`.
- After `pop()`, the stack becomes `[2, 0, 3]`.
- The minimum values during these operations are `0`, `0`, and `2`.

**Python Code:**
```python
class MinStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []
        self.min_stack = []

    def push(self, x):
        self.stack.append(x)
        # Update the minimum stack with the minimum value
        if not self.min_stack or x <= self.min_stack[-1]:
            self.min_stack.append(x)

    def pop(self):
        if self.stack:
            if self.stack[-1] == self.min_stack[-1]:
                self.min_stack.pop()
            self.stack.pop()

    def top(self):
        return self.stack[-1] if self.stack else None

    def get_min(self):
        return self.min_stack[-1] if self.min_stack else None

# Example usage
min_stack = MinStack()
min_stack.push(2)
min_stack.push(0)
min_stack.push(3)
min_stack.push(0)
min_stack.pop()
print(min_stack.get_min())  # Output: 0
```

### 3. Simplify Path
**Problem:** Given a Unix-style file path, simplify it to its canonical form.

**Example:**
- Input: `"/a/./b/../../c/"`
- Output: `"/c"`

**Explanation:**
- `"a"` and `"."` means the current directory.
- `".."` moves up a directory.
- After simplification, the resulting path is `"/c"`.

**Python Code:**
```python
def simplify_path(path):
    stack = []
    parts = path.split('/')
    
    for part in parts:
        if part == "..":
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
        elif part and part != ".":
            stack.append(part)
    
    return "/" + "/".join(stack)

# Example usage
path = "/a/./b/../../c/"
print(simplify_path(path))  # Output: "/c"
```

### 4. Daily Temperatures
**Problem:** Given an array of daily temperatures, return an array that answers how many days you would have to wait until a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, put `0`.

**Example:**
- Input: `[73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]`
- Output: `[1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]`

**Explanation:**
- For `73`, the next warmer day is `74`, so `1`.
- For `74`, the next warmer day is `75`, so `1`.
- For `75`, the next warmer day is `76` after `4` days, etc.

**Python Code:**
```python
def daily_temperatures(temperatures):
    stack = []
    result = [0] * len(temperatures)

    for i in range(len(temperatures)):
        while stack and temperatures[i] > temperatures[stack[-1]]:
            index = stack.pop()
            result[index] = i - index
        stack.append(i)

    return result

# Example usage
temperatures = [73, 74, 75, 71, 69, 72, 76, 73]
print(daily_temperatures(temperatures))  # Output: [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

### 5. Decode String
**Problem:** Given an encoded string, return its decoded version. The encoding rule is: `k[encoded_string]`, where `k` is the number of times the `encoded_string` is repeated.

**Example:**
- Input: `"3[a]2[bc]"`
- Output: `"aaabcbc"`

**Explanation:**
- Repeat `"a"` three times to get `"aaa"`.
- Repeat `"bc"` twice to get `"bcbc"`.
- Combine them to get `"aaabcbc"`.

**Python Code:**
```python
def decode_string(s):
    stack = []
    current_string = ""
    current_num = 0

    for char in s:
        if char.isdigit():
            current_num = current_num * 10 + int(char)
        elif char == "[":
            stack.append((current_string, current_num))
            current_string = ""
            current_num = 0
        elif char == "]":
            prev_string, num = stack.pop()
            current_string = prev_string + current_string * num
        else:
            current_string += char

    return current_string

# Example usage
s = "3[a]2[bc]"
print(decode_string(s))  # Output: "aaabcbc"
```

### 6. Asteroid Collision
**Problem:** We have a list of asteroids, and each asteroid moves either left or right. The absolute value represents the size, and the sign represents direction. Positive values move right, and negative values move left. Return the state of the asteroids after all collisions.

**Example:**
- Input: `[5, 10, -5]`
- Output: `[5, 10]`

**Explanation:**
- Asteroid `-5` collides with `5` but is destroyed, as `5 > |-5|`.
- Asteroid `10` remains unaffected.

**Python Code:**
```python
def asteroid_collision(asteroids):
    stack = []

    for asteroid in asteroids:
        while stack and asteroid < 0 < stack[-1]:
            if stack[-1] < -asteroid:
                stack.pop()
                continue
            elif stack[-1] == -asteroid:
                stack.pop()
            break
        else:
            stack.append(asteroid)

    return stack

# Example usage
asteroids = [5, 10, -5]
print(asteroid_collision(asteroids))  # Output: [5, 10]
```

### 7. Longest Valid Parentheses
**Problem:** Given a string containing just the characters `'('` and `')'`, find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

**Example:**
- Input: `"(()"`
- Output: `2`

**Explanation:**
- The longest valid substring is `"()"`, with length `2`.

**Python Code:**
```python
def longest_valid_parentheses(s):
    stack = [-1]
    max_len = 0

    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char == "(":
            stack.append(i)
        else:
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                stack.append(i)
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, i - stack[-1])

    return max_len

# Example usage
s = "(()"
print(longest_valid_parentheses(s))  # Output: 2
```
