# Code Vulnerability Management Process using CodeQL

## Purpose
The purpose of this document is to establish a consistent, effective process for identifying and managing code vulnerabilities using the CodeQL tool. This document provides a step-by-step guide to scan the codebase, prioritize findings, mitigate vulnerabilities, and track progress.

## Scope
This process applies to all software development teams and covers the code in repositories managed by the organization. CodeQL will be used for identifying vulnerabilities, and this document will cover only CodeQL-based scanning and management.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **Development Team:** Responsible for fixing identified vulnerabilities.
- **Security Team:** Responsible for monitoring the scans, analyzing vulnerabilities, and supporting remediation.
- **DevOps Team:** Manages the CodeQL tool, sets up scanning workflows, and automates reports.
- **Project Manager:** Monitors progress, ensures vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely manner, and escalates issues if necessary.

## Process Overview
1. **Setup CodeQL in the Repository**
2. **Run Initial CodeQL Scan**
3. **Review Vulnerabilities**
4. **Prioritize and Assign Fixes**
5. **Mitigate Vulnerabilities**
6. **Verify Remediation**
7. **Schedule Regular Scans**
8. **Report and Monitor Vulnerability Status**

---

### 1. Setup CodeQL in the Repository
   - **Install CodeQL CLI**: Ensure CodeQL CLI is installed and configured in the environment.
   - **Configure CodeQL Workflow**: Set up a CodeQL workflow in the CI/CD pipeline to scan code on every push or pull request.
   - **Language Configuration**: Identify the programming languages in use and configure CodeQL to support them.
   - **Security Rules**: Use the default security rules provided by CodeQL, or customize rules based on organization policies.

### 2. Run Initial CodeQL Scan
   - **Trigger First Scan**: Manually initiate a CodeQL scan for a baseline assessment of the codebase.
   - **Store Baseline Results**: Save and categorize initial scan results as baseline findings.
   - **Setup Notifications**: Configure notifications for critical vulnerabilities to alert relevant stakeholders.

### 3. Review Vulnerabilities
   - **Analyze Findings**: The Security Team reviews CodeQL findings to validate issues and discard false positives.
   - **Classify Vulnerabilities**: Classify vulnerabilities by type, severity, and likelihood of exploitation.
   - **Document Findings**: Document validated findings in a vulnerability tracking system.

### 4. Prioritize and Assign Fixes
   - **Severity Rating**: Rate vulnerabilities based on severity (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
   - **Risk Assessment**: Assess risks to business impact, data sensitivity, and exploitability.
   - **Assign Ownership**: Assign each vulnerability to an appropriate developer or team for remediation.
   - **Set Deadlines**: Define and document timelines for vulnerability remediation based on severity.

### 5. Mitigate Vulnerabilities
   - **Remediation**: Developers work to resolve vulnerabilities according to the prioritization schedule.
   - **Guidelines**: Follow secure coding guidelines, referencing CodeQL recommendations and fixes.
   - **Implement Workarounds**: For vulnerabilities requiring longer-term solutions, implement temporary workarounds.

### 6. Verify Remediation
   - **Re-scan**: After fixes are implemented, trigger a CodeQL scan to verify remediation.
   - **Review Fixes**: Security Team verifies that fixes address the identified issues effectively.
   - **Close Vulnerabilities**: Mark vulnerabilities as resolved in the tracking system once validated.

### 7. Schedule Regular Scans
   - **Weekly/Bi-Weekly Scans**: Schedule regular scans to detect new vulnerabilities.
   - **On-demand Scans**: Allow developers and security personnel to trigger scans as needed.
   - **Maintain Configuration**: Periodically review and update CodeQL configurations and rules.

### 8. Report and Monitor Vulnerability Status
   - **Weekly Reports**: Generate reports on open, resolved, and newly identified vulnerabilities.
   - **Metrics**: Track metrics such as Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR), the number of high-severity vulnerabilities, etc.
   - **Executive Summary**: Share summary reports with management, highlighting trends and major issues.
   - **Continuous Improvement**: Review the effectiveness of the vulnerability management process regularly and adjust CodeQL rules or workflows as necessary.

## Tools and Systems
- **CodeQL CLI**: Used for scanning and identifying code vulnerabilities.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automates CodeQL scans on code commits.
- **Vulnerability Tracking System**: Tracks and manages the lifecycle of vulnerabilities.
- **Notification Systems**: Configured to alert key stakeholders of critical vulnerabilities immediately.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Time to Remediation**: Average time taken to fix vulnerabilities by severity level.
- **Scan Coverage**: Percentage of codebase scanned and analyzed by CodeQL.
- **False Positive Rate**: Proportion of reported vulnerabilities determined to be false positives.

## Continuous Improvement
Periodically review CodeQL configurations, security rules, and workflows. Update this document as CodeQL or security requirements evolve.

By following this process, the organization can effectively manage code vulnerabilities, reduce security risks, and maintain a secure codebase.
