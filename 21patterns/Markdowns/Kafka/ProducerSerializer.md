# Kafka Producer Serializer Mindmap

## Introduction

- **Objective**
  - Learn about the Kafka Producer Serializer.

## Kafka Producer Record Transmission

- **Purpose of Kafka Producer**
  - Transmit the producer record to the Kafka broker over the network.
- **Transmission Process**
  - Does not immediately transfer records to the broker.
  - Each record undergoes several steps before transmission:
  1. **Serialization**
  2. **Partitioning**
  3. **Buffering**

## Serialization in Kafka Producer

- **Necessity of Serialization**
  - Required to send data over the network.
  - Without serialization, data cannot be transmitted to a remote location.
- **Kafka's Knowledge of Serialization**
  - Kafka does not inherently know how to serialize your key and value.
- **Specifying Serializers**
  - It is **mandatory** to specify a **key serializer** and a **value serializer**.
  - Serializers are supplied as part of the **producer configuration**.

## Example Serializers Used

- **Earlier Example**
  - **Key Serializer**: `IntegerSerializer`
  - **Value Serializer**: `StringSerializer`
- **Limitations of Basic Serializers**
  - These are elementary serializers.
  - Do not cover most real-world use cases.

## Real-Life Scenarios

- **Complex Event Representation**
  - Events are often represented by **complex Java objects**.
- **Need for Serialization of Complex Objects**
  - These objects must be serialized before transmission to the broker.
- **Limitations of `StringSerializer`**
  - Not suitable for serializing complex objects.

## Options for Serializing Complex Objects

- **Generic Serialization Libraries**
  - Kafka provides options to use generic serialization libraries such as:
    - **Avro**
    - **Thrift**
- **Custom Serializers**
  - Alternatively, you can create **custom serializers**.
- **Upcoming Demonstration**
  - Will create a **JSON serializer** in upcoming lectures.
  - Show the process of creating and using a custom serializer.

## Conclusion

- **Closing Remarks**
  - "Great. See you again."
  - "Keep learning and keep growing."
