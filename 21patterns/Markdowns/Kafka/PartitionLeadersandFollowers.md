# Classification of Partition Replicas Mindmap

## Introduction

- **Welcome Back**
  - Continuation of the previous discussion on Kafka internals.
- **Topic**
  - Classification of partition replicas in Apache Kafka.

## Classification of Topic Partition Replicas

- **Two Categories of Partition Replicas**
  1. **Leader Partitions**
  2. **Follower Partitions**

## Creation of Topic with Partitions

- **Topic Creation Parameters**
  - **Number of Partitions:** 5
  - **Replication Factor:** 3
- **Process**
  - Kafka creates 5 directories corresponding to the 5 partitions.
  - These directories are called **leader partitions**.
  - **Leaders are created first**.

## Replication Factor and Followers

- **Replication Factor Explained**
  - Specifies the number of copies for each partition.
- **Calculations**
  - **Total Copies per Partition:** 3 (Replication Factor)
  - **Existing Leader Partition:** 1 (already created)
  - **Followers Needed:** 2 additional copies per partition.
- **Kafka's Actions**
  - Creates 2 more directories for each leader partition.
  - These additional directories are the **followers**.

## Understanding Followers

- **Definition**
  - A **follower** is a duplicate copy of the leader partition.
- **Storage**
  - Both leaders and followers are stored as directories.
- **Purpose**
  - Followers replicate the data from the leader for fault tolerance and redundancy.

## Identifying Leaders and Followers

- **Using Kafka Topics Command**
  - Use the `kafka-topics` command with the `--describe` option to get details about the topic.
- **Command Output**
  - Provides information on:
    - **Leader:** The broker ID that holds the leader partition for each partition ID.
    - **Replicas:** List of broker IDs that have replicas (leaders and followers) of the partition.
    - **ISR (In-Sync Replicas):** Replicas that are currently in sync with the leader.
- **Example**
  - For **Partition ID 0**, the output shows the broker ID where the leader resides.

## Key Points

- **Leaders and Followers**
  - Each partition has one leader and multiple followers (based on replication factor).
- **Replication Factor Impact**
  - The number of follower partitions depends on the replication factor.
  - **Total Partition Replicas:** Number of partitions Ã— Replication Factor.
- **Importance**
  - Understanding the role of leaders and followers is essential for grasping Kafka's fault tolerance mechanism.

## Conclusion

- **Further Learning**
  - More details about leaders and followers will be covered in subsequent lectures.
- **Summary**
  - Recognizing that leader partitions are followed by several followers is crucial.
  - The replication factor determines the number of follower partitions.
- **Closing Remarks**
  - Great. See you again.
