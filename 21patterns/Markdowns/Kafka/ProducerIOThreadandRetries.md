# Kafka Producer Retries Mindmap

## Introduction

- **Welcome Back**
  - In this video, we will talk about the **producer retries** performed by the **background I/O thread**.

## Background I/O Thread

- **Role**
  - Responsible for **transmitting serialized messages** waiting in the topic partition buffer.

## Broker Acknowledgements

- **Message Receipt**
  - When the **broker receives a message**, it sends back an **acknowledgement**.
- **Types of Acknowledgements**
  - **Success Acknowledgement**
    - If the message is successfully written to Kafka.
  - **Error**
    - If the broker failed to write the message.

## Producer Retries

- **Error Handling by I/O Thread**
  - When the background I/O thread **receives an error** or **does not receive an acknowledgement**:
    - It may **retry sending the message** a few more times before giving up.
- **Configuring Retries**
  - You can control the **number of retries** by setting the **`retries` producer configuration**.

## Final Error Handling

- **After All Retries Failed**
  - The I/O thread will **return the error** to the **`send` method**.

## Conclusion

- **Closing Remarks**
  - "Great. See you again."
  - "**Keep learning and keep growing.**"
  - [Outro Music]
