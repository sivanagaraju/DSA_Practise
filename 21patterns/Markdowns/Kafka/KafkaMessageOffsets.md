# Kafka Message Offsets Mindmap

## Introduction

- **Welcome Back**
  - There is one critical thing to understand about Kafka messages.

## Kafka Messages and Offsets

- **Unique Identification**
  - Each Kafka message in a partition is uniquely identified by a **64-bit integer offset**.
  - Offsets are unique **within a single partition**.

- **Offset Numbering**
  - **First Message Offset:** The offset for the first message in the partition is **zero (0)**.
  - **Subsequent Messages:**
    - The offset for the second message is **one (1)**.
    - Offsets increment by one for each new message.

- **Continuity Across Segments**
  - Offset numbering **continues across segments** to maintain uniqueness within the partition.
  - The offset sequence does not reset when a new segment file is created.

## Segments and Offset Progression

- **Scenario Example**
  - **Last Offset in First Segment:** Suppose the last message in the first segment has an offset of **30,652**.

- **Segment Limit Reached**
  - When the **maximum segment limit** is reached:
    - Kafka **closes** the current segment.
    - **Creates a new segment file** for incoming messages.

- **Offset in New Segment**
  - The offset for the first message in the new segment **continues from the previous offset**.
    - **First Offset in Second Segment:** The offset would be **30,653**.

- **Segment File Naming**
  - For easy identification, the **segment file name is suffixed with the first offset** in that segment.
    - This helps in quickly locating messages based on offsets.

## Uniqueness and Scope of Offsets

- **Within a Partition**
  - The offset is **unique within the partition**.
  - Ensures that each message can be precisely identified.

- **Across Partitions**
  - Offsets **start from zero in each partition**.
  - Offsets are **not unique across the entire topic** because each partition has its own offset sequence starting at zero.

- **64-Bit Integer Offset**
  - The offset being a **64-bit integer** allows for a vast number of unique offsets within a partition.
  - Provides a unique ID to each message in a given partition.

## Locating a Specific Message

- **Challenge**
  - Since offsets are not unique across the topic (due to multiple partitions), additional information is needed to locate a message.

- **Required Information**
  - To locate a specific message, you must know:
    1. **Topic Name**
       - The name of the topic where the message is stored.
    2. **Partition Number**
       - The specific partition within the topic.
    3. **Offset Number**
       - The unique offset within that partition.

- **Implication**
  - Knowing all three pieces of information ensures you can accurately retrieve any message in Kafka.

## Conclusion

- **Final Thoughts**
  - Understanding offsets is crucial for working with Kafka messages.
  - Offsets help in message retrieval, processing, and maintaining consumer positions.

- **Closing Remarks**
  - Great. See you again.
  - **Keep learning and keep growing.**
