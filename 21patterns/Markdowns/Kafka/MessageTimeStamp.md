# Kafka Producer Record Timestamp Mindmap

## Introduction

- **Welcome Back**
  - Previously learned about the **producer partitioner**.
- **Next Topic**
  - Understanding the **timestamp** in Kafka Producer Record.

## Producer Record and Timestamp

- **Optional Timestamp Field**
  - The producer record takes an **optional timestamp field**.
  - **Message Timestamp** is optional but crucial for real-time streaming applications.
- **Importance of Timestamp**
  - For **real-time streaming applications**, the timestamp is **critical**.
  - Every message in Kafka is **automatically timestamped**, even if not specified explicitly.

## Types of Timestamping Mechanisms

- **Create Time**
  - The time when the **message was produced**.
- **Log Append Time**
  - The time when the **message was received** at the Kafka broker.
- **Mutual Exclusivity**
  - **Cannot use both** timestamping methods simultaneously.
  - Application must **decide between these two methods** when **creating the topic**.

## Setting Default Timestamping Method

- **Configuration Parameter**
  - **`message.timestamp.type`** topic configuration.
- **Possible Values**
  - **`0`** for **Create Time** (default value).
  - **`1`** for **Log Append Time**.
- **How to Set**
  - When creating a topic, set the `message.timestamp.type` to the desired value:
    - `0` for Create Time.
    - `1` for Log Append Time.

## Producer Timestamp Behavior

- **Automatic Timestamping**
  - The **Producer API automatically sets** the current producer time to the producer record's timestamp field.
- **Overriding Timestamp**
  - Can **override the automatic timestamp** by explicitly specifying the timestamp argument.
  - Message is transmitted with a **producer time**:
    - Either **automatically set** by the producer.
    - Or **explicitly set** by the developer.

## Broker Timestamp Behavior with Log Append Time

- **Using Log Append Time Configuration**
  - When **`message.timestamp.type`** is set to **`1`**:
    - The **broker overrides the producer timestamp** with its **current local time**.
    - This happens **before appending the message to the log**.
- **Producer Timestamp Overwritten**
  - In this case, the **producer time is overwritten by the broker time**.

## Timestamp Presence

- **Message Will Always Have a Timestamp**
  - Either the **producer time** or the **broker time**.
  - Ensures that every message in Kafka has an associated timestamp.

## Preferences and Recommendations

- **Using Create Time**
  - **Preferred** when using **Producer APIs** to bring data into Kafka.
    - The Producer API **automatically assigns a timestamp**.
- **Using Log Append Time**
  - **Preferred** when using **other tools** to bring data into Kafka.
    - Need to understand **how the tool handles timestamping**.
  - **Safer Method**
    - Configure the topic for **Log Append Time** (`message.timestamp.type=1`).
    - Ensures the **broker sets a timestamp** if the tool doesn't.

## Conclusion

- **Final Thoughts**
  - Understanding timestamping is crucial for accurate event time tracking in Kafka.
- **Closing Remarks**
  - **Great. See you again. Keep learning and keep growing.**
