# Advanced Kafka Producers: Horizontal vs. Vertical Scalability Mindmap

## Introduction

- **Context**
  - Previously created a simple producer that sent one million short messages to Kafka.
  - Kafka is designed for scalability.
- **Objective**
  - Explore details about scaling up Kafka producers.

---

## Apache Kafka and Scalability

- **Design for Scalability**
  - Kafka was designed with scalability in mind.
  - Scaling a Kafka application is straightforward.

---

## Horizontal Scalability

### Adding More Producers

- **Parallel Producers**
  - Each **POS (Point of Sale) system** can create a **Kafka producer object** and send invoices.
- **Multiple Producers**
  - Multiple POS systems can send invoices **in parallel**.
- **Producer-Side Scaling**
  - On the producer side, you can **keep adding new producers** to send messages to Kafka in parallel.

### Adding More Brokers

- **Kafka Brokers' Role**
  - At the cluster end, **Kafka brokers receive messages** and acknowledge successful receipt.
- **Need for More Brokers**
  - If you have **hundreds of producers** sending messages in parallel, you may need to **increase the number of brokers**.
- **Broker Capacity**
  - A single Kafka broker can handle **hundreds or thousands of messages per second**.
- **Scaling Brokers**
  - By **increasing the number of Kafka brokers**, you can support **hundreds of thousands of messages** per second.

### Achieving Linear Scalability

- **Linear Scalability**
  - This arrangement provides **linear scalability** by adding more producers and brokers.
- **Scaling Streaming Bandwidth**
  - Works perfectly for **scaling up overall streaming bandwidth**.

## Vertical Scalability

### Scaling Individual Producers

- **Opportunity for Multithreading**
  - Opportunity to **scale an individual producer** using **multithreading**.
- **When to Use Multithreading**
  - Necessary when data is **generated or received at high speed** and needs to be sent quickly.
- **Single Producer Thread Sufficiency**
  - A **single producer thread** is sufficient when data is produced at a **reasonable pace**.

### Implementing Multithreaded Producers

- **Parallelism at Producer Level**
  - Some scenarios require **parallelism at the individual producer level**.
- **Handling High Throughput**
  - Use a **multithreaded Kafka producer** to handle high throughput requirements.

### Use Cases

- **High-Speed Data Generation**
  - Applications that **generate or receive data at high speed**.
  - Need to **send data as quickly as possible**.
- **Not Necessary for Low-Frequency Applications**
  - Applications that **do not frequently generate new messages**.
  - **Example**: An individual POS application producing an invoice every **2-3 minutes**.
  - In such cases, a **single thread is sufficient** to send messages to Kafka.

## Conclusion

- **Summary**
  - Kafka provides both **horizontal** and **vertical scalability** options.
  - **Horizontal Scaling**:
    - Adding more **producers** and **brokers**.
    - Achieves linear scalability for overall streaming bandwidth.
  - **Vertical Scaling**:
    - Using **multithreading** within a producer.
    - Enhances throughput for individual producers.
- **Final Remarks**
  - "Great, see you again."
  - "**Keep learning and keep growing.**"
  - **[Outro Music]**
