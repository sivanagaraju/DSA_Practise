# Kafka Log Files and Segments Mindmap

## Introduction

- **Context**
  - Previously discussed Kafka directories and how messages are stored.
  - Now focusing on Kafka **log files** and their organization.

## Kafka Log Files

- **Purpose**
  - Messages are stored within directories in **log files**.
- **Structure**
  - Instead of one large file, Kafka splits log files into several smaller files.
  - These smaller files are called **segments**.

## Segments

- **Definition**
  - **Segments** are smaller chunks of a Kafka log file within a partition directory.
- **First Segment File**
  - Every topic partition creates an initial **first segment file**.
  - This file begins storing incoming messages.

## Demonstration

### Executing the Producer Program

- **Configuration**
  - Producer is set up to send **500,000 short messages**.
  - **Average Message Size:** Approximately **20 bytes**.
- **Execution**
  - Run the producer program to send messages to Kafka.
  - The process completes quickly due to the small message size.

### Observing Log Segment Files

- **Result**
  - After sending messages, a **bunch of log segment files** appear in each partition directory.
- **Question Raised**
  - How does Kafka decide when to split log files into new segments?

## Logic Behind Segment Splitting

- **Splitting Mechanism**
  - **Initial Storage**
    - The first message is stored in the first segment file of the partition.
  - **Continuation**
    - Subsequent messages are added to the same segment file.
  - **Segment Growth**
    - The segment file continues to grow with incoming messages.
  - **Segment Limit**
    - When the segment reaches the **maximum segment size limit**, Kafka:
      - Closes the current segment file.
      - Starts a new segment file for additional messages.
- **Outcome**
  - Multiple segment files are created within each partition directory over time.

## Segment Size Configuration

- **Default Settings**
  - **Maximum Segment Size:**
    - **1 GB of data** or **1 week of data**, whichever is smaller.
  - **Behavior**
    - Without custom configuration, segments split only after reaching 1 GB or 1 week.
- **Custom Configuration in Demo**
  - **Adjusted Maximum Segment Size:** **1 MB**.
  - **Reason for Adjustment**
    - To demonstrate the creation of multiple segments within a short time frame.
  - **Effect**
    - Multiple segments are created quickly as messages are sent.
- **Implications**
  - Smaller segment sizes result in more segment files.
  - Adjusting segment size can impact performance and storage management.

## Key Takeaways

- **Segmented Log Files**
  - Kafka divides log files into segments for efficient data management.
- **Segment Splitting Logic**
  - Segments grow until they reach a configured size or time limit.
  - Upon reaching the limit, a new segment is started.
- **Customization**
  - Segment size limits can be configured to suit specific needs.
  - Understanding segment configuration is important for optimizing Kafka performance.

## Conclusion

- **Understanding Kafka Storage**
  - Knowledge of how Kafka stores and manages log files is crucial.
- **Next Steps**
  - Continue exploring Kafka internals to gain deeper insights.
- **Closing Remarks**
  - **Keep learning and keep growing.**
