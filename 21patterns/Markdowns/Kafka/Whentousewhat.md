# Kafka Ecosystem Usage Patterns Mindmap

## Introduction

- **Recap**
  - Familiarity with Kafka ecosystem and its five components
- **Key Question**
  - When to use what Kafka components?
  - What kinds of solutions are being developed using Kafka ecosystem components?

## Three Main Usage Patterns

1. ### Data Integration Pattern

   - **Focus**: Solving data integration problems using Apache Kafka
   - **Scenario**
     - Multiple independent systems serving specific purposes
     - Systems generate, store, and own data
     - Need to send or share some part of the data with other systems
   - **Components Used**
     - **Kafka Broker**
     - **Kafka Client APIs**
     - **Kafka Connect**
   - **Role of Kafka Broker**
     - Provides a shared data bus-like infrastructure
     - Acts as a central hub for data sharing
     - Advantages:
       - Simplifies data sharing between systems
       - Offers reliability and scalability
   - **Usage Based on Application Type**
     - **Custom or Bespoke In-House Applications**
       - Use **Kafka Client APIs**
       - Implement embedded Kafka **Producers** and **Consumers**
     - **Standard Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Products**
       - Use **Kafka Connect**
       - Utilize existing connectors
       - If no connector exists:
         - Use **Kafka Connect Framework** to create one
         - Preferable over using raw Producer/Consumer APIs
   - **Common Implementation Scenario**
     - **Data Lakes**
       - Need reliable and scalable methods to bring data from hundreds of sources
       - Use Kafka to ingest data into Data Lake storage
       - After data ingestion:
         - Use tools like **Apache Spark** for further processing

2. ### Real-Time Stream Processing using Microservice Architecture

   - **Focus**: Creating real-time stream processing applications adopting microservices architecture
   - **Components Used**
     - **Kafka Broker**
     - **Kafka Client APIs** (only **Producers**)
     - **Kafka Streams**
   - **Role of Kafka Broker**
     - Provides backbone infrastructure
     - Makes data available to all microservices
   - **Purposes of Kafka in These Solutions**
     - **Creating Streams**
     - **Processing Streams**
   - **Usage Details**
     - **Kafka Producers**
       - Used by microservices to create streams
       - Implemented as embedded producers within microservices
     - **Kafka Connect**
       - May be used if streams are sourced from COTS applications
       - Not typically used within microservices
     - **Kafka Streams**
       - Used for implementing business logic
       - Achieves real-time stream processing needs
     - **Kafka Consumers**
       - Not suitable for stream processing in this context
       - Lack necessary capabilities compared to Kafka Streams
       - Kafka Streams offers easier and more powerful processing than consumers
   - **Prevalence**
     - This pattern is the most widely implemented currently
     - Common in applications requiring real-time data processing and responsiveness

3. ### Real-Time Data Warehousing Pattern

   - **Focus**: Building a real-time data warehouse using Kafka
   - **Pattern Overview**
     - Collect data from multiple source systems into a Kafka cluster
     - Use Kafka as the central data repository
   - **Data Sources**
     - Systems with **Database Backends**
       - e.g., Relational Databases
     - **Cloud-Based Applications**
       - e.g., Salesforce with REST interfaces
   - **Components Used**
     - **Kafka Connect**
       - Collects data from various sources into Kafka cluster
   - **After Data Ingestion**
     - **Use Kafka Cluster as a Data Warehouse**
     - **Model Workloads and Reporting Requirements**
       - Utilize **KSQL** for querying and data manipulation
     - **Run Queries on KSQL Server**
       - Generates real-time reports
       - Reports refresh every minute, second, or even milliseconds
   - **Advantages**
     - Provides quick and compelling solutions for businesses
     - Achieves a more real-time view of data compared to traditional warehouses
   - **Status and Evolution**
     - This pattern is relatively new and evolving
     - Requires careful design to maximize real-time capabilities
     - Potential to challenge traditional Data Warehouses and Data Lakes for real-time workloads
   - **Challenges**
     - Not all workloads can be made real-time
     - Needs to pass the adoption test in the industry

## Summary of Patterns

- **First Pattern (Data Integration)**
  - Mostly implemented in Data Lakes
  - Addresses the need for scalable and reliable data ingestion from multiple sources
- **Second Pattern (Real-Time Stream Processing)**
  - Most prevailing implementation today
  - Suited for applications requiring immediate data processing and response
- **Third Pattern (Real-Time Data Warehousing)**
  - Evolving and gaining traction
  - Aims to provide real-time analytics and reporting capabilities

## Recommendations for Developers

- **For Java Developers or Microservice Architects**
  - Focus on the following Kafka components:
    1. **Kafka Broker and Internals**
       - Understanding the core messaging infrastructure
       - Knowledge of how data is stored and replicated
    2. **Kafka Client APIs / Producer APIs**
       - Implementing producers to publish data to Kafka topics
       - Embedding Kafka clients within applications
    3. **Kafka Streams**
       - Building stream processing applications
       - Implementing business logic for real-time data processing

## Conclusion

- **Kafka Ecosystem Versatility**
  - Offers multiple patterns for different architectural needs
  - Can be tailored to solve specific problems in data integration, stream processing, and data warehousing
- **Future Outlook**
  - Kafka and KSQL are pushing boundaries towards real-time solutions
  - Adoption of new patterns depends on careful design and industry acceptance
- **Final Note**
  - Continuous learning and adaptation are key
  - Kafka's evolution presents new opportunities for developers and architects
