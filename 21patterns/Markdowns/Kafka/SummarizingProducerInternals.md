# Kafka Producer Internals Summary Mindmap

## Introduction

- **Welcome Back**
  - Recap of learning about the internal working of the Producer API.
- **Objective**
  - Summarize the Producer Internals before creating more producers.

## Producer Internals Overview

### 1. Sending Messages

- **Using `producer.send` Method**
  - We use the `producer.send` method to hand over the `ProducerRecord` to the Kafka producer object.

### 2. Serialization

- **Internal Serialization**
  - The Kafka producer object internally serializes the message key and the message value.
- **Providing Serializers**
  - Serializers are provided using the **properties object**.

### 3. Partitioning

- **Determining Target Partition**
  - The producer determines the target partition number for the message to be delivered.
- **Options for Partitioning**
  - **Custom Partitioner Class**
    - Provide a custom partitioner class using the properties object.
  - **Default Partitioner**
    - Provide a key and let the producer use the default partitioner.

### 4. Buffering Messages

- **Message Buffering**
  - The serialized message goes and sits into the buffer depending upon the destination address.
- **Separate Buffers**
  - For each destination (partition), we have a separate buffer.

### 5. Background I/O Thread

- **Role of I/O Thread**
  - An I/O thread runs in the background.
- **Picking Up Messages**
  - Picks up messages from the buffer.
- **Batching Messages**
  - Combines messages to make one single data packet.
- **Sending to Broker**
  - Sends the data packet to the broker.

### 6. Broker Interaction

- **Saving Data**
  - The broker saves the data in the log file.
- **Acknowledgement**
  - Sends back an acknowledgement to the I/O thread.

### 7. Handling Acknowledgements

- **If Acknowledgement Not Received**
  - If the I/O thread does not receive an acknowledgement:
    - It will try resending the packet.
    - Again waits for an acknowledgement.

### 8. Error Handling

- **Retries Exhausted or Error Received**
  - If no acknowledgement is received after retries or an error message is received.
- **Error Propagation**
  - The I/O thread will give the error back to the `send` method.

## Conclusion

- **Theory to Practice**
  - The concepts are theoretical but will be demonstrated using suitable examples in future lectures.
- **Closing Remarks**
  - "Great. That's all for this video."
  - "See you in the next lecture."
  - "**Keep learning and keep growing.**"
