# KSQL Mindmap

## Introduction

- **Lecture Focus**: KSQL (Kafka SQL)
  - Last item in the list of Kafka components
- **Objective**: Provide a quick overview of KSQL
  - Answer key questions about KSQL

## What is KSQL?

- **Definition**: KSQL is an SQL interface to Kafka Streams
  - Allows stream processing using SQL syntax
  - Provides capabilities of Kafka Streams without writing code in Java or Scala
  - Enables creation of scalable and fault-tolerant stream processing workloads
- **Operating Modes**:
  - **Interactive Mode**:
    - Uses a command-line interface (CLI) or web-based UI
    - Submit KSQL statements and get immediate responses
    - CLI works like any database SQL interface
    - Ideal for development environments
  - **Headless Mode**:
    - Non-interactive mode
    - Submit KSQL files executed by the KSQL server
    - Ideal for production environments
- **Summary**:
  - KSQL provides an easy-to-use SQL-like interface
  - Eliminates the need to write code for stream processing tasks

## KSQL Architecture: How Does It Work?

- **Components**:
  - **KSQL Engine**:
    - Core component responsible for KSQL statements and queries
    - Parses KSQL statements
    - Builds corresponding Kafka Streams Topology
    - Runs them as Streams tasks
    - Streams tasks are executed on available KSQL servers in the cluster
  - **REST Interface**:
    - Powers the KSQL clients (CLI or web UI)
    - Receives commands from KSQL clients
    - Communicates with the KSQL Engine to execute commands
  - **KSQL CLI**:
    - Command-line interface for submitting KSQL statements
    - Works like any SQL interface for databases
- **KSQL Server**:
  - Combination of KSQL Engine and REST Interface
  - Can be deployed in two modes:
    - **Interactive Mode**:
      - Supports interactive queries via CLI or web UI
      - Ideal for development environments
    - **Headless Mode**:
      - Non-interactive mode
      - Executes pre-defined KSQL files
      - Ideal for production environments
  - **Scalability**:
    - Multiple KSQL servers can form a scalable KSQL cluster
    - All servers in a cluster must use the same deployment mode
    - Dynamically add more servers to scale out resources
  - **Fault Tolerance**:
    - Inherent feature due to Kafka Streams
- **Interaction with Kafka Cluster**:
  - KSQL cluster is separate from the Kafka cluster
  - KSQL servers internally communicate with the Kafka cluster
    - Read inputs from Kafka topics
    - Write outputs to Kafka topics
- **Workflow**:
  - **Client Interaction**:
    - KSQL clients send commands to the REST Interface
    - REST Interface communicates with the KSQL Engine
  - **Query Execution**:
    - KSQL Engine processes statements
    - Builds Kafka Streams Topology
    - Runs tasks across KSQL servers in the cluster

## What Can You Do with KSQL?

- **Concept**:
  - Treat Kafka topics as tables
  - Execute SQL-like queries over Kafka topics
  - Use familiar SQL syntax with Kafka-specific extensions
- **Capabilities**:
  - **Filtering**:
    - Apply `WHERE` clauses to filter data in streams
  - **Aggregations**:
    - Use `GROUP BY` and aggregate functions (e.g., `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`)
  - **Windowing**:
    - Perform aggregations over time windows (e.g., tumbling, hopping, session windows)
  - **Joins**:
    - Join two or more Kafka topics (streams or tables)
    - Supports various types of joins (e.g., `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT OUTER JOIN`)
  - **Transformations**:
    - Apply functions and expressions to transform data
  - **Sink Results**:
    - Write the result of queries back to Kafka topics
    - Create new streams or tables from query results
- **Examples**:
  - **Group By and Aggregates**:
    - Compute counts or sums over data in a topic
  - **Time Window Aggregations**:
    - Aggregate data over specific time intervals
  - **Apply Filters**:
    - Select data based on conditions
  - **Join Topics**:
    - Combine data from multiple topics
  - **Sink to Another Topic**:
    - Output results to a new Kafka topic
- **Future Possibilities**:
  - **Real-Time Data Warehouse**:
    - KSQL positions Kafka as a real-time data warehouse
  - **Integration with BI Tools**:
    - Potential for JDBC/ODBC connectors
    - Visualization tools like Tableau and QlikView could connect to KSQL
  - **Wider Adoption**:
    - Makes stream processing accessible to users familiar with SQL

## Conclusion

- **Key Takeaways**:
  - KSQL provides an SQL interface to Kafka Streams
  - Offers interactive and headless modes for different environments
  - Enables powerful data processing capabilities on Kafka topics using SQL
- **Closing Remarks**:
  - KSQL is a significant advancement for Kafka
  - Moves Kafka towards being a real-time data warehouse
  - Encourages continued learning and exploration of KSQL and Kafka
- **Future Outlook**:
  - Potential for further integrations and enhancements
  - Possibility of standard connectors and BI tool support
