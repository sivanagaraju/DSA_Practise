    Start with four-letter word; goal is to reach another four letter
    word by changing one letter at a time (while forming only real words)
    until the goal is reached.

    Use queue for storage with three different implementations.

    Timing code passes in function to use for checking whether a word exists.
    This code is used to experiment with variety of options and shows
    the time results.
